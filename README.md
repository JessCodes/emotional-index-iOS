# Emote Me iOS
Emote Me iOS is the Swift mobile app that is the companion to the [Emote Me](https://github.com/JessCodes/emotional-index-iOS) Ruby on Rails web app our team built.  

The Swift app looks at a photo of the user and analyzes the user's emotions.  Based on the emotion and user preferences, the app can show the user a YouTube video or gif to improve the user's mood or keep the mood high.

The swift app uses a Ruby on Rails backend API for user login and to save their emotion to the database.  The API is also used to parse the YouTube, Twilio, and Giphy data that is displayed to the user in the app.
